# Application2_RFT
This project contains the application files for a VR rod and frame test (RFT).  

It was developed for the 2023/24 study "In Rod we Trust - The evaluation of virtual Rod and Frame Test as a cybersickness screening instrument" by J. Josupeit. 

To get access to the original Unity scene (v.2019.1.11f1) and custom created assets' scripts, go to [RFT:Project_RFT](https://github.com/JudiJ/RFT/tree/main).

Duplicated and reuploaded version of the [Application_RFT](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_RFT) repository, which showed problems after downloading the zipped files.

Download the zip-file in this project to install the full playable VR application.

## The Application
“RFT2.exe” runs the program for a VR version of the RFT: A virtual rectangular frame and a rod, implied by an opaque cuboid with two dots at both ends, are presented in a dark room. 
At the start of each trial, the rod and frame are shown rotated around their z-axis in fixed degrees (frame +/-33 or 0, and rod +/-22 or +/- 11). Using the controller, the virtual rod can be orientated in clock- and counterclockwise direction.

This project was programmed for the HTC Vive controllers. The application should work independently from the hardware, but other HMDs may have limited functionality. Oculus devices should have no controller bindings, but full visuals.

The application should run in Windows, Linux, MacOS, indiscriminately. 

### Functions
- rotate the rod clockwise with the right side, counterclockwise with the left side on the controller trackpad 
- confirm the adjustment of the rod and start a new trial by pulling the trigger at the back of the controller
- insert a participant number in the text bar in the menu
- record the VR experience
- end the application by simply right-clicking the mouse or closing the window
- save the data of each participant automatically in separate folders, with the time stamps following the format yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:fffff.

## Project Layout
The first files in this project are the "RFT2.exe" application, the files for the key and controller bindings, as well as the Unity player and crash handler files. 

Additionally, this project includes two folders:

- [MonoBleedingEdge](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_RFT/tree/main/MonoBleedingEdge) contains autogenerated information by Unity
- [RFT2_Data](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_RFT/tree/main/RFT_Data) contains the game managing files, Unity default and built-in resources, plugins, as well as global game manager, resource and shared assets.
    - The sub-folder [Managed](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_RFT/tree/main/RFT_Data/Managed) contains all dll-, pdb- and mdb-files for the application

### Supplementary
Unity game engine version v2019.1.11f1. Steam VR Assets (version 2.3.2). Custom assets created using Blender (version 2.90). 

The application was originally run with a Windows 10 (64 bit) computer, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and Intel Core i7-9700K processor.
